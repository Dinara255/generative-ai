Project Setup

1. Tech Stack Selection and Project Initialization

Frontend: Use React Native to support iOS and Android.
Backend: Use Firebase for real-time database, Node.js with Express.js for any server-based functions, and Firebase Authentication for user login.
Setup Steps:	
Initialize your project in React Native:
npx react-native init YourProjectName
Set up Firebase for the backend with authentication and real-time database features.
Use Express.js for any API setup if you have custom server functions.

Feature Coding Instructions
I. User Roles & Permissions
1. User Authentication (Admin, Teacher, Viewer)
Use Firebase Authentication or a custom JWT-based solution.
Roles: Admin, Teacher, and Viewer roles must be defined in the user database. For example:
{
  "userID": "uniqueUserID",
  "username": "teacherUser",
  "role": "Teacher",
  "profilePhotoURL": "linkToProfilePic",
  "badges": []
}
Permissions: Only Admins can access exclusive resources. Use middleware or role checks in the frontend to manage access to certain features.

2. Role-Based Access Control
When rendering content, check user roles to conditionally display features. For example:

if (user.role === 'Admin') {
  // Render exclusive features
}

II. UI/UX Design & Frontend Components
1. Navigation Bar
Implement a bottom navigation bar with tabs for Home, Uploads, Messages, Profile, and Settings.
Example Component:
<BottomTabNavigator>
  <Tab.Screen name="Home" component={HomeScreen} />
  <Tab.Screen name="Uploads" component={UploadScreen} />
  <Tab.Screen name="Messages" component={MessagesScreen} />
  <Tab.Screen name="Profile" component={ProfileScreen} />
  <Tab.Screen name="Settings" component={SettingsScreen} />
</BottomTabNavigator>


2. Profile Display (Facebook Style)

Create a Profile screen with sections for profile photo, bio, badges, and uploaded content. Organize it into separate components (e.g., ProfilePhoto, BioSection, BadgeDisplay, ContentGrid).

Example Layout:

const ProfileScreen = () => (
  <View>
    <ProfilePhoto />
    <BioSection />
    <BadgeDisplay />
    <ContentGrid uploads={userUploads} />
  </View>
);


3. Instagram-Style Feed

Implement a feed using a FlatList to display posts as cards. Each card includes a title, author, likes, and comments.

Example Card Component:

const PostCard = ({ title, author, likes, comments }) => (
  <View style={styles.card}>
    <Text>{title}</Text>
    <Text>By {author}</Text>
    <Text>Likes: {likes}</Text>
    <Text>Comments: {comments.length}</Text>
  </View>
);


4. WhatsApp-Inspired Messaging Interface

Implement a messaging interface with a chat bubble style using Firebase for real-time messaging.

Example Message Component:

const MessageBubble = ({ message, sender }) => (
  <View style={sender === currentUser ? styles.myMessage : styles.otherMessage}>
    <Text>{message.text}</Text>
    <Text>{message.timestamp}</Text>
  </View>
);


5. Stories Carousel (Instagram Stories)

Implement a horizontal scrollable carousel at the top of the feed. Use a ScrollView with horizontal orientation.

Example Carousel:

<ScrollView horizontal showsHorizontalScrollIndicator={false}>
  {stories.map(story => (
    <StoryThumbnail key={story.id} story={story} />
  ))}
</ScrollView>

III. Content Uploading System

1. Upload Screen for Teachers

File Upload: Use Firebase Storage to store files (e.g., PDFs, images). Allow Teachers to tag uploads by grade and subject.

Form Example:

<TextInput placeholder="Title" value={title} onChangeText={setTitle} />
<TextInput placeholder="Description" value={description} onChangeText={setDescription} />
<Button title="Upload File" onPress={uploadFile} />


2. Admin-Exclusive Upload Section

Limit access to the Admin upload section by checking the userâ€™s role before rendering the component.


3. Cloning Feature

Add a Clone button to each content card that creates a duplicate entry in the database under a new ID.

Example Cloning Function:

const cloneContent = (contentId) => {
  const originalContent = getContentById(contentId);
  const clonedContent = { ...originalContent, id: generateNewId() };
  saveContent(clonedContent);
};

IV. AI-Driven Features

1. Content Analysis and Suggestions

Integrate AI to analyze uploaded content, suggest improvements, and generate rubrics. You may use a pre-trained model API (like OpenAI) or set up a machine learning pipeline for specific tasks.

Example API Call for Content Analysis:

const analyzeContent = async (content) => {
  const response = await fetch("https://yourAIapi.com/analyze", {
    method: "POST",
    body: JSON.stringify({ content }),
  });
  return await response.json();
};


2. Rubric Generator

Provide options for teachers to generate custom rubrics based on assignment type. Store rubric templates and allow adjustments.

Example Rubric Component:

const RubricGenerator = ({ assignmentType }) => (
  <View>
    <Text>Select criteria for {assignmentType}</Text>
    {/* Criteria inputs */}
  </View>
);


V. Gamification and Community Engagement

1. Badge System
Track user achievements and award badges. Display badges on profiles.
Badge Logic:
if (userUploads > 10) awardBadge(userID, "Top Contributor");

2. Community Groups
Create group messaging or discussion forums. Use Firebase or a third-party messaging SDK to support real-time group chats.
Group Chat Component:
<GroupChat chatId={chatId} messages={groupMessages} />

VI. Analytics and Metrics Collection

1. Set Up Firebase Analytics
Track user engagement with key features, such as content uploads, messaging, and cloning.
Example Tracking:

logEvent('content_upload', { userId: userID, contentType: content.type });



2. User Retention and Activity Reports
Generate reports based on user activity data to understand usage trends and high-engagement features.
Deployment & Scaling

1. Optimize App Performance
Use lazy loading for images and caching where possible to improve load times.
Implement serverless functions or cloud functions for scalable backend services.
2. App Store Submission
Prepare for app stores by ensuring compliance with app guidelines and submitting icons, descriptions, and screenshots.
